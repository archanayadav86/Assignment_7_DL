Then any sequences with a shorter length than this are padded either with zeros or with special characters so that they reach the desired length"

    "Ans--> Attention mechanisms are a type of neural network layer that can be added to deep learning models. They allow the model to focus on specific parts of input by assigning different weights to different parts of the input. This weighting is typically based on the relevance of each part of the input to the task at hand"
